# DeepLearningTutorials

This repository includes simple deep learning implementations. You can see these different implementations below.

## Transfer Learning
Transfer Learning tutorial with a pretrained ResNET50 and CIFAR100 dataset. [File](https://github.com/hakansivuk/DeepLearningTutorials/blob/master/TransferLearning(TrainingRESNETWithCIFAR100).ipynb)

## Named Entity Recognition With ELMO
Named Entity Recognition with Keras by using ELMO embedding and bidirectional LSTM on top of it. [File](https://github.com/hakansivuk/DeepLearningTutorials/blob/master/NamedEntityRecognitionWithELMO.ipynb)

## Machine Translation with GRU&Attention
Machine Translation with Keras from English to Turkish by using GRU network and attention mechanism. Attention maps are visualized. [File](https://github.com/hakansivuk/DeepLearningTutorials/blob/master/MachineTranslationWithGRU&Attention.ipynb)

## Image Captioning
Image Captioning with CNN as a feature extractor and RNN for generating captions. Attention mechanism is also used. [File](https://github.com/hakansivuk/DeepLearningTutorials/blob/master/image_captioning.ipynb)
